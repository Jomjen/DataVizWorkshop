# Homework


### Research existing work

1. Look at existing work in the field of data visualisation. [Here](../References.md) are some places to start.
1. Find one project that strikes you as interesting. Compose a slack post with an image, a link and a text describing:
	* Why it inspires you
	* Who it is for
	* How you think they built it
	* What its goal seems to be

### Extras

* Get familiar with [Amanda Cox](https://vimeo.com/29391942), the queen of data visualisation.
